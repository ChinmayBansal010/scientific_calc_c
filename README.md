# Advanced Scientific Calculator

This project is an **Advanced Scientific Calculator** implemented in C, capable of performing a wide range of arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and factorial operations. The calculator is menu-driven for ease of use.

## Features

The calculator supports the following operations:

1. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division (with zero-checking)
   
2. **Trigonometric Functions** (input in degrees)
   - Sine
   - Cosine
   - Tangent
   
3. **Logarithmic Functions**
   - Natural Logarithm (base `e`)
   - Logarithm with a custom base

4. **Power and Square Root**
   - Power (base raised to a given exponent)
   - Square Root

5. **Factorial Calculation**
   - Computes the factorial of an integer

## How to Use

### Menu System

The calculator is organized into categories for easier navigation:

1. Select the desired **category** by entering the corresponding number.
2. Choose a specific operation within that category.
3. Enter the required input(s) when prompted, and the result will be displayed.

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to perform an **addition**:

- Select `1` for **Arithmetic Operations**.
- Select `1` for **Addition**.
- Enter two numbers when prompted.
- Ouput will be displayed
